# Welcome to the mountain. I'm Sisyphus, and this is my boulder.

Well, to be precise—I'm him with an adjective slapped in front: Stochastic Sisyphus™. Unless we're in reality, where I have a real name, allegedly. But that's just semantics

**Let's start with the obligatory passion statement, because that seems necessary.**
> *My process is a perpetual cycle of curiosity, transforming complexity into understanding and expanding the limits of knowledge. Learning—machine, deep, and human*
##### Honestly, the fact that I named my cat *Marvin Minsky* is a better passion statement than any string of words I can come up with
The machine is learning, under my supervision (of course). As a masochist, I spend my time optimizing models that refuse to cooperate—because apparently, I find trial and error entertaining. This is a snapshot of ongoing work and the evolution of my projects over time. Some work, some don't. Not every idea is worth a second push.

<td width="50%" valign="top">
  
**Typically Focused On:** High confidence, very predictable
- **Machine Learning:** Transformers, semantic search, multilingual models, active learning, and algorithms (both cooperative and rebellious)
- **NLP:** Retrieval, embeddings, LLMs, and teaching machines to understand context 
- **Data Science:** Pattern recognition, causality, uncertainty quantification

**Made Possible by Viewers Like You:** Not a fixed stack, just the things I use (or break) the most, a special shoutout to Python
- Built with Python and friends: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, whatever cloud/GPU setup I have the bandwidth to deal with today

### The Cycle
#### If nothing else, the name is accurate. Just me, the boulder, and the incline.
### **Perpetually uphill,**
