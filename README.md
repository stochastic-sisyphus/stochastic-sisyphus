# Welcome to the mountain. I'm Sisyphus, and this is my boulder.
## Well, to be precise—I'm him with an adjective slapped in front: Stochastic Sisyphus. 
### But that's just semantics. 

My models learn deeply. I, however, remain confused. Constantly losing the battle to the rabbit hole of research, pulled in by algorithms that adapt, systems that optimize, and models that (at the very least) pretend to be intelligent. Some projects reach completion, many stay half-explored and stuck in endless revision, and the rest get abandoned entirely—but nothing’s ever really finished.

Recursion: the cause and solution to all my problems. It’s always the same cycle—testing what works, breaking what doesn’t, and confirming that not every idea needs a second iteration.

### Typically Focused On

- **Language models & NLP**: Retrieval, embeddings, multilingual systems, making models understand nuance (or at least fake it)

- **Optimization & adaptive systems**: Search, reinforcement, algorithms that learn and occasionally refuse to behave

- **Uncertainty & complexity**: Finding patterns in noise, causal inference, making sense of what isn’t obvious

### Tools of the Trade

Not a fixed stack, just the things I use (or break) the most:

- **Machine Learning & AI**: Deep learning, transformers, probabilistic models, graph-based methods

- **NLP & Language Models**: Fine-tuning, semantic search, multilingual modeling

- **Optimization & Experimentation**: Bayesian tuning, reinforcement learning, active learning

- **Data & Systems**: Cloud pipelines, distributed processing, workflow automation

### The Cycle

If nothing else, the name is accurate. Just me, the boulder, and the incline.

**Perpetually uphill,**
