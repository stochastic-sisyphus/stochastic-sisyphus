# Welcome to the mountain. I'm Sisyphus, and this is my boulder.
### Well, to be precise—I'm him with an adjective slapped in front: Stochastic Sisyphus. 
**But that's just semantics.** 

My models learn deeply. I, however, remain confused. Constantly losing the battle to the rabbit hole of research, pulled in by algorithms that adapt, systems that optimize, and models that (at the very least) pretend to be intelligent. This is essentially a showcase of the progression of my projects over the years and a snapshot of ongoing work. Projects at various stages of completion and scripts that will definitely be rewritten a few more times. Some may lead somewhere (or not), and others will probably be abandoned entirely.
An ongoing hypothesis test, confirming that not every idea needs a second iteration.

### Typically Focused On
- **Language models & NLP**: Retrieval, embeddings, multilingual systems, making models understand nuance (or at least fake it)
- **Optimization & adaptive systems**: Search, reinforcement, algorithms that learn and occasionally refuse to behave
- **Uncertainty & complexity**: Finding patterns in noise, causal inference, making sense of what isn’t obvious

### Made Possible by Viewers Like You
Not a fixed stack, just the things I use (or break) the most:
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Deep learning, transformers, probabilistic models, graph-based methods
- **NLP & Language Models**: Fine-tuning, semantic search, multilingual modeling
- **Optimization & Experimentation**: Bayesian tuning, reinforcement learning, active learning
- **Data & Systems**: Cloud pipelines, distributed processing, workflow automation

### The Cycle
If nothing else, the name is accurate. Just me, the boulder, and the incline.

**Perpetually uphill,**
